### peppermint
straightfoward Filament-based PBR shader targeting VRChat avatar usage, implementing an ORM workflow.

### "features"
* [Filament](https://google.github.io/filament/Filament.md.html) based, with changes and features specific to VRChat without sacrificing the PBR look
* uses ORM (Occlusion, Roughness, Metallic)
* [Light Volumes](https://github.com/REDSIM/VRCLightVolumes/tree/main) support 
* [LTCGI](https://ltcgi.dev/) support

### note
this isn't aimed to be a 'feature-packed' shader. there are some extras, like emissions, that are added out of popularity and what i find useful. first and foremost, this is a shader i made for personal usage because i like the look of PBR.
